Viki's email
Here is a summary of what I think we agreed on during that meeting
Viki has provided a clean and anonymized but partial dataset (with only the variables and cases of interest) to the Data-TSU.  The dataset collects information from the webpage https://ejatlas.org/, and should remain confidential.
In the data sent, about 2800 environmental justice cases are clustered according to their outcome (left column). Then we have cluster them (using hierarchical cluster) in 3 clusters: 
- The largest is the reform cluster (as mobilization result in some form of mediation and change)[Cluster B or 2]
- the second largest the resists cluster (as mobilization results in criminalization) )[Cluster A or 1].
- the third is a transform cluster (with mobilization resulting in some stopping of projects that result in environmental impacts) )[Cluster C or 3].

Yanina will work in the analysis including:
- a visualization of the spatial distribution of cases. Options we mentioned include
i.      Kernel density distribution of conflicts by clusters above (one map by each cluster or and overlapping map)
ii.     Distribution by IPBES regions
iii.    Adding information (color coding?) on which ‚Äúsectors‚Äù (in the dataset the variable is called ‚Äúcategory.clean‚Äù
 
- spatial overlap of mobilizations and biodiversity priorities. Do environmental mobilization happen in biologically important areas?  The logic resembles the one in Garnett article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0100-6.
i.      I do not have a clear view of what measure of ‚Äúbiologically important areas‚Äù is best. I was thinking ‚Äúbiodiversity hotspots‚Äù . But Yanina is the expert.
ii.      We could also consider the ‚Äúsector‚Äù in this analysis

- Temporal analysis of the three clusters.  Although conflicts are dynamic,  we will use ‚Äústart.year‚Äù and see whether there is a temporal evolution of the share of cases in the three clusters  (from resist to transform will be ideal for our argument‚Ä¶ üòâ)
- spatial overlap of mobilizations with other external variables (i.e., presence of democracy, income levels, etc‚Ä¶). Yanina said this is possible to the extend we provide clear guidance (i.e., what exactly).

- Yani's notes
location of conflictbinary variables¬†out = outcomes (were there...?)act = actors (people involved)mob=mobilization (how did the mobilization it happen? eg strikes)env = environmental issues addressed in the conflic¬†(eg biodiversity loss, fire)GBF = GBF targets addressing the env problem (how are conflict contributing to the different targets?)status of the project
cluster =¬†cluster¬†analysis looking at the outcomes (how conflicts are group?)¬†1- predominance of violence against activists2- mobilization ended up is some sort of reform (money, technical help)3- conflict that end up with success (project was stopped, moratory)this clustering was done for the assessment: resist, reform, transform
Look at the geographical extent of the clusters...- kernel densities- type of outcomes vs what drives the outcome (aggregating by category and then plotting)- overlapping this conflicts with biomes or biodiversity hotspots...- temporal aspect: date that the project started
KArina3 clusters and then time & space
